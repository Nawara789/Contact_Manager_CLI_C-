# Contact Manager CLI 
## Goal
Build a CLI contact manager that is fast and efficient using modern indexing

## Problems it solves: 
The outdated system relies on phone-book-style indexing approach and had several issues:
- Searching for contacts is slow and inefficient. 
- Data storage is rigid and difficult to extend. 
- The system blocks operations while loading data.
